## Checking for insults in comments
### An old 2013 Kaggle competition. 

Kaggle Details [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary)

The challenge is to detect when a comment from a conversation would be considered insulting to another participant in the conversation. Samples could be drawn from conversation streams like news commenting sites, magazine comments, message boards, blogs, text messages, etc.  

The idea is to create a generalizable single-class classifier which could operate in a near real-time mode, scrubbing the filth of the internet away in one pass.

This notebook was adapted from a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kAbFiecIG0) by [Alexandre Gramfort](http://alexandre.gramfort.net/) at a PyData 2015 conference.

Datasets can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/detecting-insults-in-social-commentary/data). Extract to the data directory before running notebook.

Have fun!
